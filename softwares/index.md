# {% include icon.html icon="fa-solid fa-code" %}Software

Our laboratory develops cutting-edge computational tools and software applications to advance human health risk assessment and toxicological research. We specialize in creating in-silico modeling platforms, text mining tools, and bioinformatics applications that bridge the gap between computational science and toxicology.

Our software portfolio includes tools for:
- **Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic (PBPK) Modeling**: Advanced simulation platforms for predicting chemical absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion in biological systems
- **Text Mining and Literature Analysis**: Intelligent tools like AOP-wiki explorer and AOP-bot for extracting valuable information from vast scientific literature
- **QSAR (Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship) Models**: Predictive models for chemical toxicity assessment
- **Ontology Development**: Tools and frameworks for developing biological ontologies using the ontology development kit
- **Systems Biology Modeling**: Computational frameworks for understanding complex biological pathways and mechanisms

These tools are designed to support New Approach Methodologies (NAMs) and reduce reliance on animal testing while providing accurate, human-relevant predictions for chemical risk assessment.
